IMPORTANT!!!!

When you export, be sure to move the png to the outside folder!! I keep forgetting to do this then missing it on accidently

Oh! forgot to add
when you export both ASEPRITE files in columns of 10, the 11th PORTRAIT will be on the 10TH FRAME!!!!

Because animations have a FRAME 0!!

Now, the game will fix this for items, but as for enemies, KEEP THAT IN MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!
