hey, cvs speaking here
im the generic text color

thanks for playing
our very basic and
pretty boring demo

these past few months
and really overall year
have led to tremendous
overall team growth

here's some answers
to your long-awaited
questions!

{FSIZE2}
is the mod even
coming out?

{{SPRcrowdwonder}}

{FSIZE1}
yea it is
don't worry xd
our team has turned
into a select group
very focused on
the overall project
so quality has
gone waaay up
in code, sprites, 
and even our rooms!

{FSIZE2}

what should we expect?

{FSIZE1}

around 150 enemies
across chapter 1 and
chapter 1.5

we'll try to
make about 60?-ish
items, but thats
not priority 
:shrug:

maybe we'll
add a character

or at best
hint to one...

{FSIZE2}

do i get a
bonus if i
was an initial
player of the mod?

{FSIZE1}

on moi discord
